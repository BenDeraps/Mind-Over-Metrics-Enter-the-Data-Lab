 title: "About Me",
 description:  ` I've learned that leadership isn't always loud. Sometimes, it's a quiet word of encouragement during a tough deadline or being the one who listens 
 when others feel unseen. I thrive in spaces where collaboration and trust are the norm, not the exception , and I take pride in being the kind of teammate who notices 
 the details, lifts others up, and helps the whole team move forward together. I love data analysis and I'm driven by the belief that behind every data set is a story 
 waiting to be understood and I thrive on turning that understanding into real, positive impact.
